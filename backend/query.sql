--=====================================
-- Queries for application reports
-- (3 with input and 3 without input for 6 in total)
--
-- ONLY REPORT #1, the Annual Report and its 6 summaries, is ready so far
--
-- The reports are:
-- 1) Annual Report to Donors (with 6 different summaries in addition
--     to the main report - so, 7 queries are needed)
-- 2) Monthly Report
-- 3) Payments Due Report
-- 4) Event Report (needs input to select the event)
-- 5) Class Representative Contact List (needs input to select the class
--     representative)
-- 6) Phonothon Volunteer Contact List (needs input to select the volunteer)
